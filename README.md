# Lending Club Case Study
> This Lending club case study aims to give an idea of applying EDA in a real bank loan scenario. In this case study, we will develop a basic understanding of Charged Off Loan in banking services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

## General Information
- Let's imagine when the bank receives a loan application, the bank has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
- Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
  * Based on data and how it is related, we can deduce if the applicant is likely to repay the loan. 
    If bank not approving the loan than the results is a loss of business to the company.
  * Suppose if the applicant is not willing to repay the loan, for example: he/she is likely to default. 
    Then the approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the bank.
